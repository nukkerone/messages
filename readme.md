# [Message] - Is a simple case of study by Gabriel Medina for learning Angular 1.2 and Laravel 4

It's an application for learning the basic stuff from two different frameworks to build web applications:

- Laravel [4] Server-Side PHP Framework
- Angular.js [1.2] Client-Side Javascript Framework
- MySQL database

It's intended to build the knowledge from a 'good practices' point of view. Using the native Framework capabilities is the main objective.

## Feature Overview

- Registering and Login System, managed by the Server-Side Framework
- Messages shared by User. A user can write/remove whatever he wants.
- Friend System. Friend can read others Messages. A user can send/accept friend requests
- Profile. Main user information goes here.
